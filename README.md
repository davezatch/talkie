Some fun with the HTML5 SpeechSynthesis API. Type in text and play it back in different voices

Built with Yeoman's Backbone Generator, with Bootstrap 3.  Uses the HTML5 [Web Speech API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html).

Some code taken from [HTML5 Rocks](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2014/01/Web-apps-that-talk---Introduction-to-the-Speech-Synthesis-API).
